# Coursework Examples

There are a number of assignments that I feel showcase my way of thinking and attention to detail, and some variation in the focus of my studies. 

- AlgorithmsHomework7: Various inductive and NP proofs.
- AlgorithmsWrittenAssignment2: A developed algorithm and proof of stability of modified Stable Matching Problem.
- ComputerArchitectureHomework1: A variety of bit-level, C coding problems, documented in LaTeX. 
- ComputerLogicDesignProject3Report: A report for a project to develop a keyboard controller on an FPGA using VHDL through Vivado.
- mazeGen.c: A c program to generate random mazes and their solutions.
- NumericalComputingHomework7 & NumericalComputingHomework8: Various solutions to computational problems in MatLab, documented in LaTeX.
- ParallelAlgorithmsKrylovSubspaceCompare: The final report for a project to compare two Krylov Subspace Methods for solving linear systems.
- TannersFPI: The MatLab code to my bisection / fixed-point iteration algorithm for finding the n>1 root of m>1, using a weighted babylonian map to condition the curve for fast convergence, with algorithm step animations available.
