# Solo Projects

The contained projects were completed by me alone, and I feel they showcase my coding style a little better, at least in Java. 

- Auction House: For this project, I developed a three-application system to simulate a live auction performed via communication between AuctionHouse, Agent, and Bank servers. This project heavily follows the Actor model, using thread-safe queues for asynchronous communication.
- Human Benchmark: We were tasked with replicating each of the mini-games at https://humanbenchmark.com/. I used JavaFX in combination with some common data and style files to trim down individual game code.
- Mexican Train Game: For this project, I created a command-line version of the Mexican Train Game. I designed a MexTrainGame object that could be created and interacted with by any UI, separating the display of the game from the logic. When announced, there were tentative plans to have a second phase of this project where we were expected to move from command-line to GUI.
