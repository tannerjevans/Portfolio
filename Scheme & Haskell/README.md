# Scheme and Haskell

Declarative Programming was one of my favorite courses, an opinion which I am aware was not shared by many of my classmates. Perhaps for this reason, we were not expected to embark upon any large projects in Scheme or Haskell. I have collected here some number of assignments and tests completed throughout the course.
