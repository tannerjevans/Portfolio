Welcome! No repository is complete without a good ReadMe. If you have landed here, I certainly hope it means you are considering an application of mine. At the bottom of this document, I have provided information about the contents of this repository ([link!](#about)), but I have taken the opportunity to tell you a bit about me that is not easily synopsized in Git repo format.

## About This Repository {#about}
As I am a recent graduate, the material located in this repository is mainly comprised of a variety of class projects and assignments. Much of the material is collaborative in nature, and I have carefully extracted where possible my own contributions.
