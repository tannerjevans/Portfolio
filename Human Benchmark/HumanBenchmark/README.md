# HumanBenchmark

This application does not utilize any command line arguments. Its entry point
 is main in HumanBenchmark.  
 
HumanBenchmark does not feature any testing or debugging tools or options. 

The entirety of the coding was completed by Tanner J. Evans. 

Bugs:
<li/> The typing game is incomplete, and has been removed from the list of
 minigames. Time was sparing.
<li/> Resources like the stylesheet and dictionary text file are located in
 the main sources folder, mainly because Java seemed to be unable to
  recognize their paths when placed separately. Time ran out while trying to
   solve this issue.
